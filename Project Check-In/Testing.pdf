Testing and Problems:

- encountering issues where I wasn't using the correct process to load the MIDI data
SOLUTION: got help and was able to finally get working audio output

- cannot stop playback once started
SOLUTION: add a stop button

- the playback tempo is not preserved when stopping and restarting another playback instance 
    (it defaults back to 111 BPM no matter what the ending value of the slider reads)
SOLUTION: preserve the slider's tempo as an absolute priority, ensuring that whatever tempo it reads is used

- note values are hanging and overlapping when the tempo is shifted
SOLUTION: scale note durations relative to the playback speed to maintain the right spacings
