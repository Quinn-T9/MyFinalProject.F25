So far, I have made decent strides with setting up the infrastructure needed in terms of a user interface.
I have the general background and layout squared away, apart from a few minor issues.
One of the major aesthetic issues I'm having is with making sure the buttons are center aligned on the page. (I believe we talked about this last week)

Bigger concerns are as follows:

I haven't created the actual programming needed to have each part as a playback. 
I have preliminary note names and sequences as a comment, but I still need actual code to make that data usable.
I'm also still unsure about a good way to visually represent the MIDI information being played back that the user can see in real time.
Whether that would take the form of a MIDI keyboard playback, actual music notation, or some other form of visual representation like we see in Logic or Ableton.
