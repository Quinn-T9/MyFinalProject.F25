this is the stuff I'm telling you about

I would like to ideally create a fully programmed piece of music using WebAudio with the ability to manipulate certain parameters like gain and key signature. I would also like to see if there's a way to manipulate the tempo of the playback during any playback sessions as an extra control slider in the website itself.
This would use a series of oscillators with unique envelopes and a set array for the playback of the song that takes inputs from different user controls.

Timeline needs to be visible, decide what notes are played and when
a counter that works at a constant rate (either in seconds or beats per minute)

Anticipated Resources:
Oscillators
Envelopes
Control surfaces
User Interface
Playback functionality
MIDI note sequence

Timeline Milestones:
October 27: Requirements Analysis
November 3: Design and Prototyping
November 10: Development of Synthesizer Tones
November 17: Development of Oscillator Sequences
December 1: Testing of Final Project
December 8: Finished Project
