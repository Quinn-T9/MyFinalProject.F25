I've been having difficulties with integrating MIDI decoding into my main project.
I have some new code in another repository that I've been experimenting with, but I may need to look into some help from the internet on how to make my files actually decode properly.

Things to do still:
- download and convert all MIDI parts into readable files
- continue work on back-end code and connections
- get a working design that can output audio on my finalized project repository
